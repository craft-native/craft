# Android native navigation fixture

This uses the same three `.stx` screens as the iOS navigation test in
`packages/ios/fixtures/native-navigation`. The compiler produces one route
bundle, and the generated Android app hosts it in native views with a
JavaScriptSandbox isolate per screen.

With a sibling `stx` checkout and an Android SDK/emulator available:

```bash
bun packages/android/scripts/test-native-navigation.ts
```

The instrumentation test checks native control classes, rendered route
parameters, push/replace/back (including Android's Back key), retained input
identity and value, and the absence of any `WebView` in the activity view tree.
CI uses the pinned stx-native compiler at `797a53d00b`, which installs an
initial tree atomically before sending incremental keyed mutations.

`--prepare-only` compiles the `.stx` bundle and generates the Android fixture
without needing an emulator. Set `CRAFT_KEEP_ANDROID_NATIVE_PROJECT=1` to keep
the generated project for inspection. On an emulator failure, the test prints
the activity's native view tree and the harness dumps `CraftNativeAndroid`
errors from logcat.
